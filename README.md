# To-Do Calendar & Admin Management System

A full-stack web application that combines an interactive task calendar for users with a centralized admin dashboard for system-wide task management. Built with a Node.js/Express backend and an Oracle Database, the system supports secure authentication, role-based access, and real-time task monitoring.

## Features

### User Portal

* **Interactive Calendar**
  View and select dates to manage daily tasks seamlessly.

* **Task Management**
  Add tasks with specific deadlines and view real-time **"Time Left"** countdowns.

* **Local Persistence**
  Tasks are stored in `localStorage` for fast, client-side access and persistence.

* **Theme Customization**
  Toggle between **Light** and **Dark** modes for a personalized experience.

###  Admin Dashboard

* **Centralized Statistics**
  Displays real-time counts for:

  * Total Tasks
  * Pending Tasks
  * Completed Tasks

* **Global Task Oversight**
  View all user tasks in a structured, system-wide table.

* **Management Controls**

  * Mark tasks as **Complete**
  * Delete tasks globally

### Backend & Authentication

* **Role-Based Redirection**
  Users are automatically redirected to either the **User Portal** or **Admin Dashboard** based on their role stored in the Oracle database.

* **Secure Registration**
  User registration captures:

  * Name
  * Roll Number
  * Role (User/Admin)

* **Authentication & Security**

  * Password hashing using `bcryptjs`
  * Token-based authentication with `jsonwebtoken`
